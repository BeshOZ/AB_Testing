## About Dataset
Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, "average bidding", as an alternative to the existing bidding type called "maximumbidding".
One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and would like to run an A/B test to see if average bidding converts more than maximumbidding.
